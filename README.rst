EOSC-Profiles for CATALOGUE
===========================

The Catalogue Profile allows catalogues of resources from other communities to be linked with the EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace. 
Adding other Catalogues to EOSC will make it possible for EOSC users to find and access resources offered from other research infrastructures 
that participate in EOSC.
